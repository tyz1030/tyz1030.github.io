short_title: Self-reconfigurable, Scalable, Modular Cubic Robots for Underwater Multitasking
abstract: "This work establishes a foundational methodology
for reconfigurable underwater robotic systems, introducing the
ModCube and its scalable multi-module configuration, RS-
ModCubes. These platforms are designed to support a wide
range of underwater applications through modularity and
reconfigurability. We present a modeling framework tailored
for shape-varying robotic systems, integrating hydrodynamic
effects using a Monte Carlo based frontal area approximation.
A model-based feedforward PD controller serves as the baseline
for control.
To assess performance, we draw inspiration from dexterous
manipulation, evaluating the robotâ€™s maximum task wrench
space and power efficiency. Comparative analyses evaluate the
platform against four commercial underwater robots. Exper-
imental validation, conducted through both real-world and
simulation tests, demonstrates the feasibility, scalability, and ro-
bustness of the system. Key experiments include individual and
multi-module trajectory tracking and hovering docking, laying
the groundwork for future large-scale underwater robotic
swarms."
